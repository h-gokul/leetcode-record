Common Design patterns:
<!-- 1) [Factory Design] (uses abstract class to enforce a pattern)
2) Proxy Design (uses another derived class of same heirarchial level as an intermediate wrapper to our derived class call in a given factory design)
3) Singleton Design (uses a static class variable to store a single instance of the class and block creating multiple instances. )
4) Composite Design (a main derived class recieves other derived classes as arguments or uses them as variables)
